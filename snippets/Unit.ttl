    skos:definition "A unit of measure, or unit is a particular quantity value that has been chosen as a scale for measuring other quantities the same kind (more generally of equivalent dimension). For example, the meter is a quantity of length that has been rigorously defined and standardized by the BIPM (International Board of Weights and Measures). Any measurement of the length can be expressed as a number multiplied by the unit meter. More formally, the value of physical quanitity Q with respect to a unit (U) is expressed as the scalar multiple of a real number (n) and U, as Q = nU."@en ;
