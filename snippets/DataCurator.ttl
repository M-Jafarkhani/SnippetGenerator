    skos:scopeNote """While the DataManager is concerned with digital maintenance, the DataCurator's role encompasses quality assurance focused on content and metadata. DataCurator responsibilities include: checking completeness of the submitted dataset against the content as described by the submitter; verifying standard metadata according to the applicable system or schema; adding or verifying specialized metadata to add value and ensure access across disciplines; and determining how the metadata might map to search engines, database products, and automated feeds. Repository managers as well as data librarians working in the repository fall within this category.
