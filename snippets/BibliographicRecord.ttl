    rdfs:comment "A record that uniquely describes a particular textual or data publication (or a work in preparation for publication). Each bibliographic record is a set of entities describing aspects of the referenced work, including, for example, but not restricted to: authors, title, journal, publication year, DOI, ISSN, publisher and copyright information, or, in the case of a data publication: creators, title, version, archive, publication year, DOI or other identifier). The FRBR expression of a bibliographic record is a bibliographic reference, which usually contains only a sub-set of these entities, ordered in a particular way that corresponds to the house style of the publication in which it occurs."@en ;
